Today I will be discussing one of the most powerful features in
Swift programming language, type `extension.`

Extension is a way that we can control types that we did not
implement, or do not have access to, to add additional functionalities
to the type without need to know how the type was implemented. This
does not only apply to user created types but all to the default 
api types that shipped with swift.
